    <h1>A Journey of Growth, inspired by The Twelve Pillars</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p1>After reading chapters 4 through 7 of Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, I found several key lessons that can have a significant impact on my life, both personally and academically. These chapters focus on goal setting, time management, surrounding oneself with positive influences, and lifelong learning - all of which resonate deeply with me.</p1> <br><br>
    <p2><b>Chapter 4 - Achieve Your Goals:</b>In this chapter, the idea that "the major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it" struck me the most. Rohn and Widener emphasise the transformative nature of working toward goals, suggesting that the personal growth one experiences is often more valuable than achieving the goal itself. This relates to my own academic and personal journey. As a second-year student in computer information systems, I often set goals around improving my coding skills or excelling in group projects. However, it's not just about getting good grades; it's about the persistence, problem-solving, and discipline that each of these goals fosters in me. I realise that while I may not achieve all of my goals overnight, the person I become through this process is what truly matters.</p2> <br><br>
    <p3><b>Chapter 5 - The Proper Use of Time:</b>Time management is crucial, especially when juggling academic responsibilities, personal life, and self-care. Rohn and Widener emphasise that many people focus on urgent but not important tasks, wasting precious time that could be directed toward long-term success. This resonates with me, as I often find myself swamped with assignments but sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture—my future career. Learning to prioritise tasks that directly align with my long-term goals, will allow me to use my time more effectively.</p3> <br><br>
    <p4><b>Chapter 6 - Surround Yourself with the Best People:</b> In this chapter, the authors stress the importance of associating with people who inspire and challenge you. This advice has reminded me of the role my father plays in my life. Despite facing his own challenges, particularly raising me as a single parent, he has always maintained a calm, balanced perspective. His approach to life, summed up in his favourite quote, "Don’t spend your time pushing boulders uphill... flow like the stream," has taught me the value of resilience and calmness in the face of difficulties. Like the lesson from this chapter, my father has been an example of how surrounding yourself with people who live by positive values can uplift you.</p4> <br><br>
    <p5><b>Chapter 7 - Be a Lifelong Learner:</b>The idea of lifelong learning is something I deeply connect with, especially as I navigate the complexities of my degree. Rohn and Widener argue that formal education is only the beginning—true success comes from self-education and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge. This has encouraged me to not only focus on my coursework but to go beyond it by learning new programming languages and staying updated with advancements in technology. My anxiety, which often isolates me, has ironically provided the perfect opportunity to focus on self-education and personal growth, much like Rohn suggests.</p5> <br><br>
